## ToDo

Here a random list of things to do as next steps
 - [x] remove keycloak as gatekeeper
 - [ ] configure private and public keys for jwt publication
 - [ ] create config maps and secrets for creating jwt and assign them to the proper services
 - [ ] query the house api to create the house
 - [ ] query the guest api to create guest and associate with the house
 - [ ] in some way the responses of the apis should be stored for further more uses (save them into the file?)
